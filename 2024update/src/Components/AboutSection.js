          <p>
            Iâ€™ve always loved being creative and solving problems. Web development and design is the perfect blend of both. I enjoy creating unique sites, and I get to fix them if anything goes wrong.

            When I'm not coding, I also find joy in writing, gaming, watching Barcelona games, spending time with friends & family, or traveling!
